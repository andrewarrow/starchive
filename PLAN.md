20-Step Plan: Building Intelligent Blend Automation

  Foundation (Steps 1-5):
  1. analyze-segments - Add energy/volume analysis to segments (RMS, peak levels)
  2. beat-detect - Detect beat positions in both tracks using onset detection
  3. auto-match - Intelligent BPM/key matching that picks the best direction automatically
  4. conflict-detect - Detect when vocal segments would overlap and warn
  5. segment-trim - Auto-trim silence from segment edges for cleaner placement

  Smart Placement (Steps 6-10):
  6. smart-random - Random placement that avoids vocal collisions and favors beat alignment
  7. gap-finder - Analyze instrumental track for vocal gaps (low energy periods)
  8. quantize - Snap all placements to nearest beat boundaries
  9. energy-match - Place high-energy vocals over low-energy instrumental sections
  10. call-response - Detect vocal phrases and place segments in the gaps between them

  Musical Intelligence (Steps 11-15):
  11. structure-detect - Basic verse/chorus detection using repetition analysis
  12. vocal-density - Analyze vocal density to avoid overcrowding sections
  13. harmony-suggest - Suggest pitch shifts for segments to create harmonies
  14. crossfade-auto - Automatically add crossfades to prevent audio clicks
  15. mix-balance - Auto-adjust volumes based on segment energy and overlap

  Advanced Features (Steps 16-20):
  16. template-system - Save/load arrangement templates for different mashup styles
  17. quality-score - Score the current blend based on musical rules (key compatibility, timing,
  etc.)
  18. auto-arrange - Combine all analysis into intelligent automatic arrangement
  19. style-presets - Different arrangement styles (minimal, dense, call-response, harmony-heavy)
  20. magic-blend - The one-command solution that does steps 1-19 automatically with best practices
